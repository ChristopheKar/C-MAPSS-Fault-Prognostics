# Turbofan Engine Degradation Prognostics

This project aims to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for turbofan engines based on some sensor values.
The engine degradation was simulated using C-MAPSS under different conditions, and the dataset is provided by NASA [here](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan).
